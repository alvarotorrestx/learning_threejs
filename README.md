# Learning Three.js Journey

Welcome to my journey of learning [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)! This repository is a collection of projects, experiments, and progress updates as I dive deeper into the world of 3D rendering and graphics with Three.js.

## About

This repository serves as:
- A documentation of my learning process.
- A showcase of my projects and experiments with Three.js.
- A way to demonstrate consistent GitHub activity and progress in learning new technologies.

## Current Focus

- **Starting Point:** Exploring Three.js with vanilla JavaScript and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast project setup and development.
- **Future Goals:**
  - Integrating Three.js with React for more dynamic and interactive applications.
  - Moving into TypeScript to enhance code reliability and maintainability.
